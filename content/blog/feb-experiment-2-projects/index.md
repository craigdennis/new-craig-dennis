It is time for experiment 2. Create a micro-project each day.

This year instead of setting new year resolutions for 2021, it was 12 experiments instead. One for each month. You can see what I have planned [here](https://www.craigdennis.me/12-experiments-2021/).

This month it is microprojects that I will be working on. 

I will being doing a project a day from this course on Udemy by [Brad Traversy and Florin Pop is 50 projects for 50 days.](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) It will help brush up my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript because I have not been coding as much as I would like.

Each day I will attempt to complete the project without looking at the solution. And only if I struggle will I use it for help.

This article will be where you can keep up to do with the project that I have completed.
